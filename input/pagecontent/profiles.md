Note that the 2 'CreatedBy' references are to support the ability for end-users to create and modify PractitionerRole
resources (to ensure that they are updated by the organizations/people that created them). The other references are
the key 'structural' relationships with the PractitionerRole recording a Practitioner working for an Organization at
a Location.
