2. The integrating application sends an HTTP POST request (a FHIR create) containing the PractitionerRole details E.g. Post\<Endpoint>/PractitionerRole
3. The request is validated - ALT: Validation failure. OperationOutcome resource returned
4. A PractitionerRole record is created and a hpi-practitionerrole-id issued
5. The HPI FHIR API confirms a successful update â€“ HTTP 201 Created status code
6. The integrating application indicates to the user the create has been successful
7. The integrating application retains the hpi-practitionerrole-id and version number for future requests relating to this record
