### Create Practitioner

#### Overview

A Create Practitioner operation is initiated by a user who needs to add a new practitioner record to the HPI.

**Expectations**

* Prior to creating a new practitioner record an authorised user must complete a thorough [search of the HPI](./searchPractitioner.html) to ensure the person does not already exist.
* Duplicate HPI records will not be checked upfront, but will create a task for a potential duplicate to be resolved.
* If the person is found in the HPI then an update operation is required. If not found then a create practitioner operation should be completed.

Create Practitioner processing steps:

1. The user initiates creating a new Practitioner in the integrating application
2. The integrating application sends an HTTP POST request (a FHIR create) containing the Practitioner details E.g. Post\<Endpoint>/Practitioner
3. The request is validated - ALT: Validation failure. OperationOutcome resource returned
4. A Practitioner record is created and a Practitioner ID issued (hpi-person-id)
5. The HPI FHIR API confirms a Practitioner record has been created – HTTP 201 Created status code
6. The integrating application indicates to the user the record has been successfully created
7. The integrating application retains the hpi-person-id and version-id for future requests relating to this record
