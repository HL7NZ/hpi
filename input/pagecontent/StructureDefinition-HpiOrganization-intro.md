The Organisation resource represents any organisation that provides healthcare services.

HPI Organisations each have an identifier in the format  GXXNNN-C where X is alphanumeric, N is numeric and C is a check character

 Organisations are primarily legal entities e.g. Companies, Charitable trusts etc but can also be Sole traders or informal partnerships.

Organisations can also be parts of a legal entity that ‘trade’ as if they were a separate entity. These ‘sub-organisations’ will be related to their parent.

An example of an organisation with sub organisations would be a Company owning a number of discrete pharmacies . Each of the pharmacies would be set up as a separate organisation (sub-organisation) with each being related to the parent Organisation (organization.partOf)

Wherever possible Organisations are validated by the assignment of the NZBN.
