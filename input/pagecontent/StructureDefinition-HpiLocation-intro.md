The Location resource represents named Facilities at which an organisation provides health services

HPI Facilities each have an identifier in the format FXXNNN-C where X is alphanumeric, N is numeric and C is a check character

A facility can only be related to a single organisation (location.managingOrganization).

 There can be many facilities at the same address – each related to a different organisation.

 An organisation may have multiple facilities at the same address – each with a different purpose.
